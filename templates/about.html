        What could be better on a hot summerâ€™s day than a delicious Ice cream?
        Whether you want to treat yourself or family and friends to ice cream or want to bring joy to a
        party or simply helps your family to enjoy some cool moments.
        Regardless of whatever the reasons, ice cream is something that works wonders: it cheers up the mind.
        With summers getting warmer and winters milder, ice cream is no longer a seasonal delight in India.
        It is consumed over the year. An excellent slice, scoop, bar or cup of ice cream is sure to boost anyone's 
        spirits and spread cheer all around.Just as a quick refresher,Ice Cream makes everything Better.
